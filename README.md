A Flexible Tool for EM-Radiation-emitting Semiconductor Heterostructure Optimization using Quantum models

This is a program written in Python 2.7. You need to have Python 2.7 installed to use and modify this software
to your needs. The current implentation also uses numpy.

For a demonstration, run 

1) "QCLexample.py" (Requires the NEGF8 program package)
2) "example_sewself.py" (Requires the sewself program)
3) "example_sewlab.py" (Requires sewlab version 4.6.4 or later)
4) "test_optim.py" (No requirements, this is a test of the optimization scheme)

Good luck!
