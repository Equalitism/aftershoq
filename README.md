A Flexible Tool for EM-Radiation-emitting Semiconductor Heterostructure Optimization using Quantum models

This is a program written in Python 2.7. You need to have Python 2.7 installed to use and modify this software
to your needs.

For a demonstration, run "QCLexample.py". This requires the NEGF8 program package to be installed, and to 
change the variable "binpath" in "QCLexample.py" to the absolute path of your NEGF binaries.

Good luck!
