Module containing Interface class. This class is intended as parent class to
model interfaces, which should implement the following methods:

runStructures( structures, path )   :  Run structures in list "structures".
                                       "Path" is the working directory which
                                       contains the tree of structures.
gatherResults( structures, path )   :  Prepare and gather model results, 
                                       put the results in the respective 
                                       structure as new attributes.
waitforproc()                       :  Wait for all processes to finish.
__init__()                          :  Optionally add model-specific arguments

If the model uses additional numerical parameters, define one or more new 
dictionaries and in __init__() call self.numpar.update( _new_dict_ )
